		<h1>UserSetup</h1>    
        <P>If you install NDO at your development machine, NDO is able to find 
        the NDO Provider plug-ins – it simply looks at the NDO installation 
        folder. If you install your NDO application at the users computer, the NDO 
            installation folder doesn't exist. This setup enables 
        you to define a folder, which gets registered as NDO folder. That way you can define 
            a place, where NDO finds your Provider dlls. The setup writes a dummy AddIn file 
            to the following location:</P>
        <P>&nbsp;</P>
        <P>%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\Microsoft\MSEnvShared\AddIns\NDOUser.AddIn</P>
        <P>&nbsp;</P>
        <P>In the AddIn file is an entry that defines a folder path, where NDO looks for 
            Providers. For example, if the entry looks like that:</P>
        <P>&nbsp;</P>
        <P>&lt;Assembly&gt;C:\Program Files(x86)\NDO 2.1 Dev Edition\Provider&lt;/Assembly&gt;</P>
        <P>&nbsp;</P>
        <P>This is the path, where NDO searches the providers.</P>
        <P>&nbsp;</P>
        <h2>How to use the UserSetup</h2>
        <P>You can use it as part of your installation. It has two operation modes, 
            unattended and with UI. We recommend to use the unattended mode with your 
            installations. Suppose, your application is installed at the following path:</P>
        <P>C:\Program Files(x86)\YourCorporation\YourApplicationPath</P>
        <P>&nbsp;</P>
        <P>Then call UserSetup.exe with this path as parameters. UserSetup will write an 
            .AddIn file with the following entry:</P>
        <P>&lt;Assembly&gt;C:\Program 
            Files(x86)\YourCorporation\YourApplicationPathl\Provider&lt;/Assembly&gt;</P>
        <P>&nbsp;</P>
        <P>That means, that NDO will search for providers in the directory</P>
        <P>C:\Program Files(x86)\YourCorporation\YourApplicationPath\Provider</P>
        <P>&nbsp;</P>
        <P>If you don&#39;t provide a parameter to UserSetup, UserSetup will ask for the NDO 
            installation folder. The user has to select your appllication folder in the 
            folder browser dialog in order to install the correct &lt;Assembly&gt; entry into the 
            .AddIn file.</P>
        <P>&nbsp;</P>
