After installation check, if you can find the .AddIn file 
at the right place:

%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\Microsoft\Microsoft\MSEnvShared\Addins

The .addin file should be something like NDOxy.AddIn, 
where x is the major version and y the minor version of NDO.

On Windows 7 the ALLUSERSPROFILE variable resolves to 
C:/ProgramData, where C: is your system drive.

If the file isn't there, copy the .addin file from your 
installation directory to the Addins folder. 
Create the directories, if they don't exist.

Edit the .AddIn file. In the <Assembly> section enter 
the path to the NDOEnhancer.dll, so that it looks like that:

<Assembly>D:\Program Files\NDO 2.1 Dev Edition\NDOEnhancer.dll</Assembly>

The path should be your NDO installation directory.

In order to find the provider path, NDO reads this path, and adds the 
"Provider" directory to it. In the above example, NDO searches the 
providers in the following folder:

D:\Program Files\NDO 2.1 Dev Edition\Providers
