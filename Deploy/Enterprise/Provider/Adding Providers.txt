Run the UserSetup.msi and enter this directory in it. Copy the Provider DLLs into this directory. 
After that, NDO finds the providers during development.

The UserSetup just creates a Registry Key 

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\HoT - House of Tools Development GmbH\NDO\1.1

This Key contains a value "AddInPath". The value contains the directory, where NDO tries 
to find the Providers.
