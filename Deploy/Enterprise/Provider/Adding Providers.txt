NDO installs a Registry Value InstallDir under the following key:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\NDO

NDO is considered a 32 bit application by the installer. That's the reason, why the installer places NDO in the Wow6432Node key. If you run NDO on a 32 bit system (which is not recommended) the key is

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\NDO

NDO searches the providers in this directory. If you run NDO on a computer without NDO installed, providers will be searched for in the Location-Directory of the AppDomain. But you have always the possibility to make the providers available system wide, if you place the InstallDir value in the registry. The following lines are an example for a .reg file which can be installed with a double click:

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\NDO]
"InstallDir"="C:\\Program Files (x86)\\NDO 2.1 Dev Edition\\"
