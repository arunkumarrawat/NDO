Thanks for testing NDO!

The solutions show the 6 Steps of the NDO tutorial.
See the NDO documentation for the tutorial.

- It runs only with VS 2010 and .NET 4.0.
- It uses the SQLite database. This is a file based 
  lightweight database deployed together with NDO.
- The applications can be run as x86 and AnyCPU targets. 
  Therefore under 64bit Windows it can be run as 32 and 64 bit app.

- Open the VS solution
- Right click on the TestApp project item in the Solution Explorer and choose   
  "Set as startup project"

After that, the TestApp should be able to run. 
In case of any difficulties, drop me a mail:
