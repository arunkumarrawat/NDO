# NDO.Oracle

This is a provider package for .NET Data Objects (NDO) versions >= 5. 
It's intended to adapt to the Oracle ADO.NET provider to NDO.

### Note

If you can avoid using Oracle Databases for your projects, then avoid it. Use MySql or MariaDb instead. SQL Server is also used very intensively with NDO and is probably the best tested database.
