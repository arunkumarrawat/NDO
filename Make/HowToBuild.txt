Adjust the directories marked in the MakefileEnt.txt and in the MakeEnt.bat.

Then run the MakeEnt.bat.

If you run the build under Vista run it as Administrator (right click on the MakeEnt.bat 
and choose "Run As Adminstrator"). Since Vista changes the current directory in that case, 
add a line 

@cd c:\blah\NDO\Make

to force the change to your make directory.

After a successful build the NDO distribution files reside in the Deploy directory.

Then do the following:

- Replace the string YourAddInPath in the file NDOEnhancer.AddIn 
  with the path the NDOEnhancer.dll resides in.
- Determine the value of the environment variable ALLUSERSPROFILE. 
- Copy the NDOEnhancer.AddIn into the folder

  %ALLUSERSPROFILE%\Application Data\Microsoft\MSEnvShared\Addins

  If the folder doesn't exist, just create it.

- After this, VS 2005 will detect the NDO Add-in.
